## Interview Bot

Thanks for interviewing at loanpal.

#### Instructions:

Create a 'bot' that can help a customer apply for a mortgage. 
The bot should prompt for certain inputs and then parse the input given by the user.
`result.txt` contains the responses that the user will give.
`interview_bot.txt` contains a mock of how the data should look.

#### Guidlines:

* You can use any language you would like
* The command line is a fine UI for this exercise, but if you would like to use something else, your choice

#### Stretch Exercises:

If you finish the basic exercise, consider the following:
* How can you make your app robust enough to handle off-script input
* If this were an API enpoint, how would you approach saving the state between requests
